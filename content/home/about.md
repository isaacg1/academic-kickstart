I'm Isaac Grosof, a first-year computer science PhD student at CMU.

I am advised by [Mor Harchol-Balter](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/).

My research is in queueing theory, scheduling, and performance modeling.

In the past, I have researched the complexity theory of abstract motion planning with [Erik Demaine](http://erikdemaine.org/) and information theoretic cryptography with [Vinod Vaikuntanathan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/vinodv/).
